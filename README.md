# The 18F Command

A set of command line utilities to standardize common functions here at 18F.

## Installation

```
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/18f/18f-cli/release/install
bash ./install
```

If you'd like to keep a copy of the `git` repository around:

```
git clone https://github.com/18f/18f-cli/
cd 18f-cli
bash ./install
```

## Usage

```
18f [options] <subcommand> [subcommand options] <args>
```

### `18f init`

Turns the current directory into a `git` repo with proper `LICENSE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, and `.about.yml` files.

### `18f setup`

Runs the setup script found in https://github.com/18f/laptop. Used to set up a new computer or update an existing one. See that repo for more information about customizing the script through `~/.laptop.local`.

### `18f validate`

Checks a repo to see whether it has the standard 18F files, as created by `18f init`.

### `18f deploy`

Deploys a project to Cloud Foundry (and, more specifically, cloud.gov).

### `18f scan`

Allows a variety of pre-configured scans to be run on a project. Currently supports:
- Accessibility (§ 508)

### `18f brand`

Downloads the 18F brand assets, either in whole or in part. Useful as a periodic check to keep assets up-to-date.

### `18f upgrade`

Upgrade the `18f` command to the latest version

### Extra scripts

This repo also includes some scripts for standalone use, either in continuous integration services or on cloud.gov.
- `cf-db.sh`: get a `psql` binary for use on cloud.gov and connect to the database.
- `deploy.sh`: a deployment script for deploying from a continuous integration service

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional information.

### Local development

This script is really a bundle of scripts: one main script and a bunch of subcommands. The main script—called `main`—looks for scripts named `18f-whatever` in `/usr/local/bin/` and makes them available as `18f whatever`.

New scripts should be added to this repository's `bin` folder without the `18f-` prefix, as that will be added during installation. They can be written in any language, but care should be taken to choose a language that most users will have. Similarly, there is a preference for avoiding additional dependencies in new scripts.
